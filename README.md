# Todo List - Challenge

#### Goal:
Build a Todo list as a mini front-end application. You don't have to use a database, the front-end is more important - you can use an appropriate data structure stored somewhere in your JavaScript (this time only!)

## Set Up
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bower install`
3. Run `npm install`
4. `open index.html ` to see the list on the browser

## Testing
Run `npm test` for unit tests

## Approach
I started by planning on paper what the very most basic todo list should do. Then worked on implementing each feature in AngularJS, writing tests first. These are the basic features of my app:

1. Add a task (that gets stored in a array in JavaScript)
2. Mark a task as done
3. Delete a task

## To Be Done:
* Edit a task
* Filter tasks
* Clear completed tasks
* Acceptance tests in Protractor
* Make it look nice with Bootstrap
* Use LocalStorage to make the list persist in the browser
